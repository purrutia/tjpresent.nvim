# `tjpresent.nvim`

Hey, this is a plugin to present markdown files!!

# Usage

```lua
require("tjpresent").start_presentation {}
```

Use `n` and `p` to navigate presentation and `q` to quit.

# Purpose

This is a follow up of the set of videos of @tjdevries. This was a gift for all of us during the advent of neovim. I'm going to create a branch for every part of the videos.
